<p>Led the planning and execution of our participation in this trade show, where we exhibited alongside four of our OEM partners. We were targeting decision-makers across various subsegments of the aerospace industry.
</p>


<h2>Pre-event</h2>
 
<p> I developed a pre-show campaign that included emails to existing prospects, organic social media posts targeting attendees, a press release, and booked meetings ahead of time. I worked closely with sales to identify high-value accounts and send direct invites to them during the event.
</p>
<p>I secured our booth location and led the booth layout and design. In addition to our main booth, we featured two extra banners on the show floor to boost visibility. I developed and deployed a comprehensive pre-show campaign that included targeted emails to existing prospects, organic social media posts aimed at event attendees, and a press release. I also pre-booked meetings and collaborated with the sales team to identify high-value accounts.</p>

<h2>During the event</h2>
<p>
Our booth showcased branded videos, including content from our OEM partners, and we had sales and OEM staff to engage with the visitors. We captured leads by scanning attendee badges and boosted booth traffic through a raffle promotion.
</p>
<p>
We distributed a press release announcing a new partnership signed during the trade show, which was then featured in the event’s morning newsletter.
</p> 

<H2>Post-event</H2>
<p>
We launched segmented follow-up campaigns based on lead interest and engagement. Leads were added to either sales cadences or nurturing flows with educational content.

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>
