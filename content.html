								<h2>CLEANING EVOLUTION</h2>

								</span>
								
								<p>Over the last 50 years, the Aircraft and Engine Maintenance and Repair (AEMR) business, now commonly referred to as MRO, has undergone a significant shift in attitudes towards component cleaning and the technologies employed. </p>
								<p>Changes can be observed in the way parts are now cleaned (involving less manual work and including automated processes), and in the higher degree of relevance in the workshop. </p>
								  
								<h2>NEGLECTED OBSCURE AREA </h2>
								<p>Historically, the cleaning bay was, and in many MRO operations still is, an area hidden from visitors. Often poorly lit and neglected. A process area that lacks investment and management attention. </p>
								<p>Under those circumstances, the fact that the cleaning process is a crucial step in the maintenance cycle was ignored. As a consequence, a large amount of time was consumed by parts cleaning, and a significant number of parts were sent back to the initial point for recleaning. Slowing the flow and affecting the shop's efficiency. </p>
								<h2>THE LIGHT WAS TURNED ON </h2>
								<p>Thanks to the tightening of regulations and standards, the old cleaning model evolved. Several traditional chemicals involved in the cleaning process were banned because they were harmful to individuals and the environment. </p>
								<p>In certain parts of the world, where Environmental Health and Safety regulations are stringent and rigorously enforced by regulators, the industry was compelled to change. </p>
								
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/New age tec 2 of 2.jpg" alt="" /></span> 

								As a result, new technologies are available to meet aerospace standards and to upgrade the importance of the cleaning stage, where reliability, precision, and workplace safety are indispensable. </p>
								<h2> NEW AGE CLEANING TECHNOLOGY </h2>
								<p>Naturally, the successful implementation of new tools in the cleaning area resulted in reduced manual work, fewer errors, shorter cleaning cycles, and the capability to trace and reproduce processes. </p>
								
								<p>These changes led to a New Age Cleaning Technology that many MROs and OEMs are adopting as their cleaning standard. </p>
